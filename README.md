# The Conehead

![Image of The Conehead the cricket shaped PCB](/images/conehead.jpg)

*The Conehead* is the next series of our critter based PCBs (past ones are *The Lady*, *The Gent*, and *The Monarch*). It's an audio circuit that synthesises the sound of a cricket. It uses three oscillators interacting with each other to create the distinctive sound. Using a small speaker and a phototransistor, the cricket will change its chirping frequency depending on the amount of light it 'sees'.
