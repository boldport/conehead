# The Conehead

![Image of The Conehead the cricket shaped PCB](/images/conehead.jpg)

*The Conehead* is the next series of our critter based PCBs. It is an audio circuit that synthesises the sound of a cricket. It uses three oscillators interacting with each other to create the sound. Using a little 13mm speaker and a phototransistor the cricket will change it's chirping frequency depending on the amount of light available. This project is produced and built using [PCBmodE](http://pcbmode.com).
